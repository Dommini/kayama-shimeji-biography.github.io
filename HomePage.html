            Hi! I'm Quinciak - for friends Kama - and this is page for Kayama
            Shimeji - my Danganronpa OC!
            <br />
            <br />
            First, I would like to thank all the people who helped me create
            this project, and Dominik for creating this website. I know it took
            a while, but it's finally here!
            <br />
            <br />
            I decided to make a small FAQ about the project and the author
            herself, so please read the rest of the content :)

            You may know me from creating fandom memes, but I mainly create
            artworks, cosplay and sometimes I also do DIY and edit videos.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am in many fandoms related to games such as Sally Face, Tekken, or
            TV shows such as Don't Hug Me I'm Scared or Popee The Performer.
            However, the greatest recognition.
            <br />
            <br />
            I got it thanks to Danganronpa. I have known this series for a very
            long time, but it was only in 2021 that I decided to join the group
            of fans. This is how my adventure with creating my character began,
            which was initially not supposed to be as big project as before.

            This is the website of my Danganronpa OC. There you can find useful
            informations about Kayama, and trivia, that are worth knowing. Its
            entire story flows seamlessly from the main original lore, which
            makes it quite enjoyable to read when you know the entire story from
            Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc, Super Danganronpa 2: Goodbye
            Despair and all episodes anime from this universe :)

            Even though most of the subpages are ready, they are blocked - Why?
            I wanted to build tension and curiosity among visitors to this
            website, hence the decision to provide a temporary "ERROR 403",
            which suggests that the content will be unlocked later. I will
            inform you about the opening of specific pages on my Instagram
            Stories, so I recommend checking there often!

            Let's start from the beginning - when I getting to know the first
            Danganronpa game I started creating Kayama's concepts right from the
            very beginning, which were not spectacular, at least considering
            Danganronpa style and drawing basics were at a lower level than now.
            However, it was only in August 2023 that I revealed the first work
            on the first sprite, and already at the beginning of 2024 her
            Introduction saw the light of day.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since then, I have been working hard on my character's story, which
            is why my Instagram account suffered a bit due to lack of activity.
            I must admit that the last few months have been a difficult time for
            me, which made me lose the enthusiasm to create new content. This
            also delayed my work on this project.
