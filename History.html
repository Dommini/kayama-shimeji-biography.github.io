      <h2>History</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
    <div class="title">Prior to the Tragedy</div><br><br>
    From an early age, Kayama grew up in Poland with her parents until
    her father went to Japan to work to support the family.
    Her mother was a artist and sold paintings,
    but the money was too small to cover basic needs.
    <br>
    <br>
    While attending high school in her country, Kayama experienced unpleasant treatment from her classmates due to being
    a mixed race and quite clumsy. She was physically and emotionally abused by other people which always ended with
    Kayama being reprimanded. She is reluctant to talk about the situation where she was deliberately pushed down the
    stairs during a school break, suffering serious injuries that required her to have stitches. She decided to cover
    the scars with bandages, and subsequent motorcycle accidents added several new marks around her neck and arms. She
    also mentions how old school bullies never faced any consequences. This whole experience made Kayama distrustful and
    backward with social interactions, and the slightest taunt towards her caused her to become aggressive.
    <br>
    <br>
    Kayama changed schools and moved to Japan. She was an ambitious child who liked to learn new things, which her
    parents quickly noticed. A year before joining Hope's Peak Academy, she met Mondo, with whom she quickly became
    friends. After collecting enough money, her parents decided to enroll her in Hope's Peak Academy for the Reserve
    Course, so that she could develop traditions in Japan, while meeting new people.
    <br>
    <br>
    During her first trimester, Kayama didn't have many friends, so she spent all her time on self-development, which
    contributed to her passion for playing video games and riding bikes, gaining attention from other students and the
    management of Hope's Peak Academy, until she did not suffer a serious knee injury that prevented her from continuing
    to ride. After purchasing her first motorcycle, Kayama took part in tournaments, winning cups and medals. The
    director Jin Kirigiri, noticing her emerging talent, suggested that she move on to the Main Course. They wanted to
    encourage people to continue paying for the Reserve Course, presenting Kayama as a living example of a person who
    gained his talent "through this school". They allowed her to join Class 77-B before the end of her first trimester.
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="title">Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School - Despair Arc</div><br><br>
    <b>Episode 02 - My Impurest Heart for You</b><br>
    A few weeks after Chisa Yukizome starts working as a teacher, Kayama first appears at the door of Class 1-B during
    Akane's training with Nekomaru, which initially surprises the others. She explains that she is a new student from
    the Reserve Course and will be taking this class, remaining on the Main Course as the Ultimate Car Racer. Chisa
    enthusiastically welcomes her new student when the other students are skeptical about the new person, but everyone
    was curious about how she gained her talent, being in the Course for people without talent.
    <br>
    <br>
    While the others were playing video games, Kayama stood by and watched everyone else having fun. She was nervous to
    go up and ask if she could join, so she was in the background, watching Kazuichi as well, listening to him brag
    about the screen he had built.
    <br>
    <br>
    When it appeared that Hiyoko had added Sexy Sexy Soup to food, Kayama couldn't resist the temptation to praise and
    interact with Kazuichi, and her stress was temporarily relieved by the soup's side effect.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Episode 03 - A Farewell to All Futures</b> <br>
    At the beginning of the episode, Kayama and her classmates walked past Hajime heading toward the Main Course
    building. Later that day, Kayama was with her classmates during the break time in the school's park. She listens to
    music on headphones at an empty table, staring at the others.
    <br>
    <br>
    After a while, her MP3 breaks and she starts complaining loudly, which catches Ibuki's attention. She then calls
    Kazuichi and asks him to take a look at the device. Wanting to impress Sonia, Kazuichi starts boasting about his
    knowledge by quickly repairing her MP3. Kayama is surprised by his skills and smiles shyly, thanking him.
    <b>Episode 04 - The Melancholy, Surprise, and Disappearance of Nagito Komaeda</b><br>
    Kayama sits in a desk with the other students in the classroom, worrying about tomorrow's practice exams. Near the
    end, she learns that Chisa Yukizome position has been changed for the Reserve Course, which makes Kayama frown in
    concern.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Episode 05 - The Beginning of the End</b><br>
    When Chisa Yukizome transferred to the Reserve Course, the class's attendance began to decline due to Kayama. She
    believed that it was not worth wasting time on games and fun, she preferred to develop her talent, so she often
    missed school days. When Chisa returned, she quickly noticed that someone was missing, along with Hiyoko, who later
    appeared in the doorway, surprising her with her more mature appearance.
    <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, as Kayama is riding her motorbike back home, the wallet bomb that Junko left behind after getting out of
    the car explodes in front of her eyes, pushing her away several meters. The whole incident is noticed by Mondo, who
    helps her up and back to normal. Unfortunately for Kayama, she suffered serious bruises and abrasions.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Episode 06 - A Despairfully Fateful Encounter</b><br>
    While the rest of the class was moving to the new school building, Kayama, wrapped in bandages, tries to recover
    from the accident. She states that he cannot join her classmates in this state. After a while, Chisa visits her,
    checking how she is doing, wanting to find out the reasons for her absence, but Kayama assures her that she will
    return to her class only when she recovers.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Episode 07 - The Biggest, Most Atrocious Incident in Hope's Peak Academy's History</b><br>
    Kayama receives a message sent by Junko regarding the truth about the Reserve Course and The Tragedy of Hope's Peak
    Academy, which shocked her so much that for a split second she had predictions in her head that portended something
    bad. Despite her injuries, he goes to the new school building. She tries to wade through the crowd to get into the
    building, but unfortunately she is quickly pushed by the rest of the outraged students, falling to the floor and
    losing consciousness.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Episode 08 - The Worst Reunion by Chance</b><br>
    Nagito, wanting to return to Hope's Peak Academy, notices Kayama lying in the crowd, so he decides to push through
    the remaining students, taking her to the school nurse's room without any obstacles. Seeing her unconscious state,
    he hopes she will be okay, noticing potential in her that he cannot describe, and leaves the room to greet the class
    after a long absence.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Episode 10 - Smile at Hope in the Name of Despair</b><br>
    Finally, Kayama wakes up from unconsciousness and as she slowly gets up with a headache, she notices the students
    lying in front of the school gate and after a while she again suffers from vision attacks, but forces herself to
    leave the room and leave the school, announcing that there may be it's dangerous to be here. When she reaches home,
    she falls on her bed, her predictions haunting her. Falling into a deep sleep, she experiences another prophetic
    dream, telling about a great, desperate tragedy.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Episode 11 - Goodbye, Hope's Peak Academy</b><br>
    When their final lesson before graduation takes place, Kayama wakes up late, even though she did everything to
    prevent it. Before Chisa begins her speech, she notices that Kayama is missing, and then appeals to the others to
    find her after the meeting ends. Meanwhile, while riding her motorbike, Kayama notices dark clouds that worry her.
    When she gets there, suddenly there is an explosion in the building, and Kayama, seeing it, quickly turned back from
    the scene in fear.
    <br>
    <br>
    At the end of the episode, when the deeds of the Remnants of Despair are presented, Kayama seeks shelter, stealing a
    Monokuma mask from the street and a damaged baseball bat to defend himself.

    <br>
    <div class="title">During the Tragedy</div><br><br>
    During the Tragedy, Kayama escaped from the Ultimate Despairs by riding her motorbike. One day there was an accident
    in which her vehicle was destroyed, so she had to walk even though she injured her knees. While outside, she used a
    baseball bat to defend herself against barbed wire, and a Monokuma mask to hide her identity. She successfully
    destroyed nearby robots and machines, much to Junko's annoyance. As there was a live broadcast of the Killing Game,
    Kayama often watched the event in which Mondo also participated.
    <br>
    <br>
    When one of the Ultimate Despair tried to catch her, she hide in a tight alley where Kazuichi happened to be. She
    bump into him and beg him to spare her life in exchange for helping him work on the machines. Kazuichi was
    unconvinced at first, but eventually agreed to the deal, hiding her from the other Ultimate Despairs in his
    workshop.
    <br>
    <br>
    Kayama often helped Kazuichi and had her own duties such as getting some scrap metal and parts for his machines. One
    day, while she was routinely on the surface looking for additional components for the robots, she came across the
    students who had survived Junko's first Killing Game. She decided to join the Future Foundation with them, creating
    a plan to capture the Remnants of Despair.

    <div class="title">Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair (coming soon)</div><br>
    When Junko died, Kayama joined the Future Foundation as a member of Squad 10 and worked with them until the
    formation of Neo World, where Makoto Naegi secretly gathered the Remnants of Despair to reverse Junko's influence
    and restore them to their pre-Tragedy state. Kayama also joined Class 77-B due to the seed of despair she gained
    while free. Wanting not to arouse suspicion with Kayama's sudden disappearance, they "sent" her to Towa City to help
    Toko and Komaru.

    <div class="title">Danganronpa 2.5: Nagito Komaeda and the World Vanquisher</div><br>
    <b>Real-life</b><br>
    After Nagito awoke from the simulation, he learned that all of his friends, including Kayama, were alive and awake
    from the Neo World Program. He boarded the boat with the rest of Class 77-B and they all then headed for the Future
    Foundation Headquarters.
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="title">Side: Hope - The Academy of Hope and Students of Despair</div><br>
    Kayama returned in Side: Hope alongside the rest of the Class 77-B, who had been resurrected by Izuru Kamukura
    although Izuru was now combined with the personality and memories of Hajime. Kayama and her classmates arrived at
    the island where the Future Foundation Headquarters were situated, having left from Jabberwock Island and proceeded
    by rescuing Byakuya Togami and Yasuhiro Hagakure from being trapped under rubble, they then began their fight
    against Ryota's brainwashed rescue squad troops, including the Super High School Level Elite Task Force.
    <br>
    <br>
    Kayama appears with jet roller skates, which Kazuichi probably created so she could move faster anywhere. Holding a
    baseball bat stripped of barbed wire, she stuns most of the Super High School Level Elite Task Force of Future
    Foundation shooters to aid Hajime Hinata attempt to reach the broadcasting tower where Ryota was situated.
    <br>
    <br>
    Later on, Kayama helped convince Ryota to abandon his plan to brainwash the world. When Kazuichi mentions that
    Hajime is from the Reserve Course, Kayama adds that she was barely present at all and they still consider her to be
    part of their class.
    <br>
    <br>
    As everyone begins to return to the boat, Kayama is the last to pass Makoto Naegi. When he asks if she's sure she
    wants to go back to Jabberwock Island, she hesitates for a moment, but finally states that they need a guardian from
    the Future Foundation who will monitor them. She also says that she can't just abandon her classmates like that.
    <br>
    <br>
    Kazuichi is approached by Kayama, who thanks him for the jet roller skates that came in handy during the fight.
    Kazuichi states that this is not a problem for him when suddenly Kayama kisses him on the cheek, which surprises him
    and his face turns red. Additionally, Sonia states that they would make a good duo, to which Kayama also blushes. He
    then jokingly called her "Miss Kayama", which caught her off guard.
