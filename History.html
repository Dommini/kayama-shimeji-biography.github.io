        <h2>Prior to the Tragedy</h2>
      </div><br><br>
      From an early age, Kayama grew up in Poland with her parents until her father went to Japan to work to support the
      family. Her mother was an artist and sold paintings, but the money was too small to cover basic needs.
      <br>
      <br>
      While attending high school in her country, Kayama experienced bullying from her classmates due to being a mixed
      race and quite clumsy. She was physically and emotionally abused by other people which always ended with Kayama
      being reprimanded. She was reluctant to talk about the situation where she had been deliberately pushed down the
      stairs during a school break, suffering serious injuries that required her to have stitches. She decided to cover
      the scars with bandages. She gained more marks on her neck and arms due subsequent motorcycle accidents. She also
      mentions how old school bullies never faced any consequences. This whole experience made Kayama distrustful and
      reserved with social interactions. The slightest taunt towards her makes her act aggressive.
      <br>
      <br>
      Kayama changed schools and moved to Japan. She was an ambitious child who liked to learn new things, which her
      parents quickly noticed. A year before joining Hope's Peak Academy, she met Mondo, and surprisingly quickly
      befriend him. After saving up enough, her parents decided to enroll her in Hope's Peak Academy for the Reserve
      Course, so that she could learn Japanese traditions, while meeting new people.
      <br>
      <br>
      During her first year, Kayama didn't have many friends, so she spent all her time on self-development, which
      contributed to her passion for playing video games and riding bikes, she gained attention of other students and
      the management of Hope's Peak Academy, until she did not suffer a serious knee injury that prevented her from
      continuing to ride. After purchasing her first motorcycle, Kayama took part in tournaments, winning cups and
      medals. The director Jin Kirigiri, noticing her emerging talent, suggested she would move on to the Main Course.
      They wanted to encourage people to continue paying for the Reserve Course, presenting Kayama as a living example
      of a person who gained their talent "thanks to this school". They allowed her to join Class 77-B before the end of
      her first year.

        <h2>Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School - Despair Arc</h2>
      </div><br><br>
      <b>Episode 02 - My Impurest Heart for You</b><br>
      A few weeks after Chisa Yukizome started working as a teacher, Kayama first appears at the door of Class 1-B
      during Akane's training with Nekomaru, which initially surprises the others. She explains that she is a new
      student from the Reserve Course and will be taking this class, remaining on the Main Course as the Ultimate Car
      Racer. Chisa enthusiastically welcomes her new student while the other students are skeptical about the new
      person. They feel a bit curious about how she managed to gain her talent, despite being previously in the Reserve
      Course.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      While the others were playing video games, Kayama stood by and watched everyone else having fun. She was nervous
      to go up and ask if she could join, so she kept herself slightly distanced, watching Kazuichi and listening to him
      brag about the screen he had built.
      <br>
      <br>
      When it turned out that Hiyoko had added aphrodisiac into the soup, Kayama couldn't resist the temptation to
      praise and interact with Kazuichi. Her stress was temporarily relieved by the soup's side effect.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Episode 03 - A Farewell to All Futures</b> <br>
      At the beginning of the episode, Kayama and her classmates walked past Hajime heading toward the Main Course
      building. Later that day, Kayama was with her classmates during the break time in the school's park. She was
      listening to music on headphones at the empty table, staring at the others.
      <br>
      <br>
      After a while, her MP3 breaks, making her complain loudly. It catches Ibuki's attention, so she called Kazuichi
      and asked him to take a look at the device. Wanting to impress Sonia, Kazuichi started bragging about his
      knowledge by quickly repairing her MP3. Kayama was surprised by his skills and smiled shyly, thanking him.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Episode 04 - The Melancholy, Surprise, and Disappearance of Nagito Komaeda</b><br>
      Kayama sits at a desk with the other students in the classroom, worrying about tomorrow's practice exams. Near the
      end, she learns that Chisa Yukizome's position has been changed for the Reserve Course, which makes Kayama frown
      in concern.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Episode 05 - The Beginning of the End</b><br>
      When Chisa Yukizome transferred to the Reserve Course, the class's attendance began to decline because of Kayama.
      She believed that games and fun were a waste of time, since she preferred to work on developing her talent, so she
      often missed the school days. When Chisa returned, she quickly noticed that someone (Kayama) was missing, along
      with Hiyoko, who later appeared in the doorway, surprising her with her more mature appearance.
      <br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, as Kayama was riding her motorbike back home, the wallet bomb that Junko left behind after getting out
      of the car explodes in front of her eyes, pushing her away several meters. The whole incident was noticed by
      Mondo, who helped her get up and back to normal. Unfortunately for Kayama, she suffered serious bruises and scars.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Episode 06 - A Despairfully Fateful Encounter</b><br>
      While the rest of the class was moving to the new school building, Kayama, wrapped in bandages, tries to recover
      from the accident. Kayama stated that she couldn’t join her classmates in this state. After a while, Chisa gave
      her a visit to check how she’s doing, wanting to find out the reasons for her absence, but Kayama assures her that
      she will return to her class once she recovers.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Episode 07 - The Biggest, Most Atrocious Incident in Hope's Peak Academy's History</b><br>
      Kayama receives a message sent by Junko regarded the truth about the Reserve Course and The Tragedy of Hope's Peak
      Academy, which shocked her so much that for a split second she had prophetic visions in her head that portrayed
      something bad. Despite her injuries, she goes to the new school building. She tried to push through the crowd to
      get into the building, but unfortunately she’s quickly pushed by the rest of the outraged students, falling to the
      floor and lost consciousness.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Episode 08 - The Worst Reunion by Chance</b><br>
      Nagito, wanting to return to Hope's Peak Academy, notices Kayama lying in the crowd, so he decides to push through
      the remaining students, taking her to the school nurse's room without any issues. Seeing her unconscious state, he
      hopes she will be okay, noticing potential in her that he cannot describe, before leaving the room to greet the
      class after a long absence.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Episode 10 - Smile at Hope in the Name of Despair</b><br>
      Finally, Kayama wakes up from unconsciousness and as she slowly gets up with a headache, she notices the students
      lying in front of the school gate. After a while, she suffers from vision attacks once again, but forces herself
      to leave the room and exit the school, thinking it might be dangerous to be here. When she reaches home, she falls
      on her bed, her visions haunting her. Falling into a deep sleep, she experiences another prophetic dream, telling
      about a great, despairful tragedy.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Episode 11 - Goodbye, Hope's Peak Academy</b><br>
      When their final lesson before graduation takes place, Kayama wakes up late, even though she did everything to
      prevent it. Before Chisa begins her speech, she notices that Kayama is missing, and then appeals to the others to
      find her after the meeting ends. Meanwhile, while riding her motorbike, Kayama notices dark clouds that worry her.
      When she gets there, something in the building explodes suddenly, and Kayama, seeing it, quickly retreated from
      the scene in fear.
      <br>
      <br>
      At the end of the episode, when the deeds of the Remnants of Despair are presented, Kayama seeks shelter, stealing
      a Monokuma mask from the street and a holding baseball bat to defend himself.

        <h2>During the Tragedy</h2>
      </div><br><br>
      During the Tragedy, Kayama escaped from the Ultimate Despairs by riding her motorbike. One day there she had an
      accident in which her vehicle was destroyed, so she had to walk even though she injured her knees. While outside,
      she used a baseball bat to defend herself against barbed wire, and a Monokuma mask to hide her identity. She
      successfully destroyed nearby robots and machines, much to Junko's annoyance. As there was a live broadcast of the
      Killing Game, Kayama often watched the event in which Mondo also participated.
      <br>
      <br>
      When one of the Ultimate Despairs tried to catch her, she hid in a small alley where Kazuichi happened to be. She
      bumps into him and beg him to spare her life in exchange for helping him work on the machines. Kazuichi was
      unconvinced at first, but eventually agreed to the deal, hiding her from the other Ultimate Despairs in his
      workshop.
      <br>
      <br>
      Kayama often helped Kazuichi and had her own duties such as getting some scrap metal and parts for his machines.
      One day, while she was routinely on the surface looking for additional components for the robots, she came across
      the students who had survived Junko's first Killing Game. She decided to join the Future Foundation with them,
      creating a plan to capture the Remnants of Despair

      <b>Episode 01 - Third Time's the Charm</b><br>
      Kayama and Kazuichi are seen in the flashback working on his Giant Monokuma project shown at the beginning of the

      Monokuma's mask.

      When Junko died, Kayama joined the Future Foundation as a member of Squad 10 and worked with them until the
      formation of Neo World, where Makoto Naegi secretly gathered the Remnants of Despair to reverse Junko's influence
      and restore them to their pre-Tragedy state. Kayama also joined Class 77-B due to the seed of despair she gained
      while free. Wanting not to cause suspicion by Kayama's sudden disappearance, they "sent" her to Towa City to help
      Toko and Komaru.

      After Nagito awoke from the simulation, he learned that all of his friends, including Kayama, were alive and awake
      from the Neo World Program. Nagito got into the boat with the rest of Class 77-B and they all then headed for the
      Future Foundation Headquarters.

      </div><br>
      Kayama returned in Side: Hope alongside the rest of the Class 77-B, who had been resurrected by Izuru Kamukura,
      now combined with the personality and memories of Hajime. Kayama and her classmates arrived at the island where
      the Future Foundation Headquarters was situated, left from Jabberwock Island and proceeded by to rescue Byakuya
      Togami and Yasuhiro Hagakure from being trapped under rubble. They began fighting against Ryota's brainwashed
      rescue squad troops, including the Super High School Level Elite Task Force.
      <br>
      <br>
      Kayama appeared with jet roller skates, which Kazuichi probably created so she could moved faster anywhere.
      Holding a baseball bat without barbed wire, she stunned most of the Super High School Level Elite Task Force of
      Future Foundation shooters to aid Hajime Hinata attempted to reach the broadcasting tower where Ryota was
      situated. Later on, Kayama helped convince Ryota to abandon his plan to brainwash the world. When Kazuichi
      mentions that Hajime is from the Reserve Course, Kayama added that she was barely present at all and they still
      consider her to be part of their class.

      As everyone begins to return to the boat, Kayama is the last to passed Makoto Naegi. When he asked if she's sure
      she wanted to go back to Jabberwock Island, she hesitated for a moment, but finally stated that they needed a
      guardian from the Future Foundation who would monitor them. She also said that she can't just abandon her
      classmates like that.
      <br>
      <br>
      Kazuichi is approached by Kayama, who thanked him for the jet roller skates that came in handy during the fight.
      Kazuichi stated that this was not a problem for him when suddenly Kayama kissed him on the cheek, which surprised
      him and his face turned red. Additionally, Sonia stated that they would made a good duo, to which Kayama also
      blushed. He then jokingly called her "Miss Kayama", which caught her off guard.
