        <p>
          Kayama, despite her calm demeanor at first glance, can be chaotic and
          hot-headed. She’s a person who likes to compete and prove own point.
          She doesn't let anyone get under her skin and will use force to defend
          herself if necessary. At the beginning of the Killing School Trip, she
          struggles to control herself calm, not very active in the conversation
          group. However, this changes over time and she becomes more open to
          interactions between classmates when she feels comfortable. She’s
          backward in social interactions, sometimes leading to awkward
          situations or confusion from others. Her sarcastic attitude irratates
          some persons around. Despite her rebellious behavior, she tries to
          lighten the mood with jokes.
          <br />
          <br />
          She's clumsy, and has a habit of bump into various objects in its
          path, hence the bandages on her body. Kayama also has a short memory
          and quickly becomes distracted, forgetting the simplest activities
          such as eating or sleeping. Adrenaline often driver her to make
          radical decisions, that often regretted later. She hates ordinary and
          failures, when her restrict it quite a lot, usually rebelling.
          Failures trigger her anger and disappointment, and has tendency to
          destroy objects around.
          <br />
          <br />
          Before the Tragedy and during Killing School Trip she is in love with
          Kazuichi, which is why she wants to impress him most of the time by
          complimenting him on in a non-obvious way, which means he doesn't
          fully understand her intentions. Although she has problems with her
          emotions and feelings, and sometimes doesn’t understand herself. After
          time she becomes bolder towards him, which results in showing her
          perverted side when they starts conversation.
          <br />
          <br />
          She can sometimes be cold towards people who have been gone. She finds
          it difficult to trust anyone, keeping her distance. She has low
          self-esteem, so she often criticizes herself, turning everything into
          a joke, hiding her weakness. When someone wants to be friends, she
          demands proof because she doesn't believe anyone will like her.
          <br />
          <br />
          Kayama also has its own quirks and preferences. One of them is
          hypersensitivity to germs and dirt. She offers to wash Kazuichi's
          dirty jumpsuit. In Island Mode Kayama talks about how she would like
          to "get close" with someone in a car, away from prying eyes.
          <br />
          <br />
          In Chapter 3, Kayama also becomes infected with the disease of
          despair. From a positive nature, she becomes depressive and
          pessimistic, and her self-confidence disappears, which initially
          surprises others. Her loud voice becomes quiet and gloomy, which does
          not suit her character.
          She has a good memory and can remember every detail. Like Mikan, she
          is able to plan and manipulate others to her own advantage. Under the
          influence of the disease, she tried to hurt herself in front of others
          to get Kazuichi's arouse sympathy.
          <br />
          <br />
          Like the rest of the sick, her personality returns to normal and she doesn't remember anything after being healed.
