        <h2>Personality</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Kayama, despite her calm demeanor at first glance, can be chaotic and
        hot-headed. She’s a person who likes to compete and prove own point.
        She doesn't let anyone get under her skin and will use force to defend
        herself if necessary. At the beginning of the Killing School Trip, she
        struggles to control herself calm, not very active in the conversation
        group. However, this changes over time and she becomes more open to
        interactions between classmates when she feels comfortable. She’s
        backward in social interactions, sometimes leading to awkward
        situations or confusion from others. Her sarcastic attitude irratates
        some persons around. Despite her rebellious behavior, she tries to
        lighten the mood with jokes.
        <br />
        <br />
        She's clumsy, and has a habit of bump into various objects in its
        path, hence the bandages on her body. Kayama also has a short memory
        and quickly becomes distracted, forgetting the simplest activities
        such as eating or sleeping. Adrenaline often driver her to make
        radical decisions, that often regretted later. She hates ordinary and
        failures, when her restrict it quite a lot, usually rebelling.
        Failures trigger her anger and disappointment, and has tendency to
        destroy objects around.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before the Tragedy and during Killing School Trip she is in love with
        Kazuichi, which is why she wants to impress him most of the time by
        complimenting him on in a non-obvious way, which means he doesn't
        fully understand her intentions. Although she has problems with her
        emotions and feelings, and sometimes doesn’t understand herself. After
        time she becomes bolder towards him, which results in showing her
        perverted side when they starts conversation.
        <br />
        <br />
        She can sometimes be cold towards people who have been gone. She finds
        it difficult to trust anyone, keeping her distance. She has low
        self-esteem, so she often criticizes herself, turning everything into
        a joke, hiding her weakness. When someone wants to be friends, she
        demands proof because she doesn't believe anyone will like her.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kayama also has its own quirks and preferences. One of them is
        hypersensitivity to germs and dirt. She offers to wash Kazuichi's
        dirty jumpsuit. In Island Mode Kayama talks about how she would like
        to "get close" with someone in a car, away from prying eyes.
        <br />
        <br />
        In Chapter 3, Kayama also becomes infected with the disease of
        despair. From a positive nature, she becomes depressive and
        pessimistic, and her self-confidence disappears, which initially
        surprises others. Her loud voice becomes quiet and gloomy, which does
        not suit her character. She has a good memory and can remember every
        detail. Like Mikan, she is able to plan and manipulate others to her
        own advantage. Under the influence of the disease, she tried to hurt
        herself in front of others to get Kazuichi's arouse sympathy.

        <h2>Talents and Abilities</h2>
      </div><br><br>
      <b>Ultimate Car Racer</b><br>
      Kayama has been fascinated by adrenaline and competition since childhood. Video games and other students with
      talents were a big motivation for her. Bored with everyday life, Kayama decided to look for a better life, trying
      new things to discover her calling.
      <br>
      <br>
      Kayama always rode her bike to school at speed, performing dangerous tricks, which attracted the attention of
      nearby regular students who were always gossiping about her. One day, while spending time on her bike, she had an
      accident, injuring her knees, which made it impossible for her to continue riding. Not wanting to give up her
      hobby, she decided to switch to machines. For this purpose, she decided to buy her first motorcycle with her
      pocket money.
      <br>
      <br>
      During her first trimester, Kayama decided to try racing tournaments, winning cups and medals by taking first
      places. The director of Hope's Peak Academy saw her potential and offered her the opportunity to join the class of
      talented students without having to repeat the grade, giving her the title of "Ultimate Car Racer".
      <br>
      <br>
      She once challenged Mondo to a fast street race, winning it easily by passing him between narrow streets and
      obstacles.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Analitical Skills</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      During one of the Class Trial, when Kayama has an objection to Hajime statement, starts Rebuttal Showdown. She had
      doubts about Hajime's arguments, she presenting a different point of view. During the argument battle, Hajime
      unexpectedly loses. As it later turns out, Kayama was right from the beginning, and the main character takes
      lessons from it and presents new evidence, agreeing with Kayama. In next Class Trials the protagonist focuses more
      on the details and killer perspective.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Prophetic Dreams</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      While being a child, Kayama has a dream in which the world will suffer a tragic defeat, which turns out to be a
      vision years later. Junko wanted to make sure that no one would spoil her plan, so she later tasks Ultimate
      Despair to find her.
      <br>
      <br>
      In Chapter 5, Kayama has another dream about accidentally killing one of the students which ends in her execution.
      Kayama wakes up convinced that it is another prophetic dream, which causes her to start behaving strangely during
      the murder, thus exposing herself to accusations.
      <br>
      <br>
      However, not every dream means visions, so she does not know what is true and what is a figment of her
      imagination.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Extraordinary Strength and Endurance</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Despite her stature, she also has strength and great endurance. In Free Time, Kayama confesses that she often had
      to use violence to defend herself from her old school bullies. This was often successful, leaving her alone for a
      good few weeks. She spared no effort even during the Tragedy.
      <br>
      <br>
      She also shows her strength when, while flirting with Kazuichi, lifts him slightly from the ground, jokingly
      telling him about the dominance she could achieve. She also boasts about her strength by lifting heavy objects.
