        <h2>Personality</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Kayama, despite her calm demeanor at first glance, can be chaotic and hot-headed. She’s a person who likes to
        compete and prove her own point. She doesn't let anyone get under her skin and will use force to defend herself
        if necessary. At the beginning of the Killing School Trip, she struggles to control her calm, not very active in
        the conversation group. However, this changes over time, and she becomes more open to interactions between
        classmates when she feels comfortable. She’s backward in social interactions, sometimes leading to awkward
        situations or confusion from others. Her sarcastic attitude irritates some people around. Despite her rebellious
        behavior, she tries to lighten the mood with jokes.
        <br /><br />
        She's clumsy and has a habit of bumping into various objects in her path, hence the bandages on her body. Kayama
        also has a short memory and quickly becomes distracted, forgetting the simplest activities such as eating or
        sleeping. Adrenaline often drives her to make radical decisions that she often regrets later. She hates orders
        and rebels when told to do something. Failures trigger her anger and disappointment, and she has a tendency to
        destroy objects around.
        <br /><br />
        Before the Tragedy and during the Killing School Trip, she is in love with Kazuichi, which is why she wants to
        impress him most of the time by complimenting him in a non-obvious way, which means he doesn't fully understand
        her intentions. Although she has problems with her emotions and feelings, and sometimes doesn’t understand
        herself. After time she becomes bolder towards him, which results in showing her perverted side when they start
        conversation.
        <br /><br />
        She can sometimes be cold towards people who have passed away. She finds it difficult to trust anyone, keeping
        her distance. She has low self-esteem, so she often criticizes herself, turning everything into a joke, hiding
        her weaknesses. When someone wants to be friends, she demands proof because she doesn't believe anyone will like
        her.
        <br /><br />
        Kayama also has her own quirks and preferences. One of them is hypersensitivity to germs and dirt. She offers to
        wash Kazuichi's dirty jumpsuit. In Island Mode, Kayama talks about how she would like to "get close" with
        someone in a car, away from prying eyes.
        <br /><br />
        In Chapter 3, Kayama also becomes infected with the disease of despair. From a positive nature, she becomes
        depressive and pessimistic, and her self-confidence disappears, which initially surprises others. Her loud voice
        becomes quiet and gloomy, which does not suit her character. She has a good memory and can remember every
        detail. Like Mikan, she is able to plan and manipulate others to her own advantage. Under the influence of the
        disease, she tried to hurt herself in front of others to get Kazuichi's sympathy.
        <br /><br />
        <!-- Like the rest of the sick, her personality returns to normal and she doesn't remember anything after being healed. -->

        <h2>Talents and Abilities</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>Ultimate Car Racer</b><br />
        Kayama has been fascinated by adrenaline and competition since childhood. Video games and other students with
        talents were a big motivation for her. Bored with everyday life, Kayama decided to look for a better life,
        trying new things to discover her calling.
        <br /><br />
        Kayama always rode her bike to school at high speed, performing dangerous tricks, which attracted the attention
        of nearby regular students who were always gossiping about her. One day, while spending time on her bike, she
        had an accident, injuring her knees, which made it impossible for her to continue riding. Not wanting to give up
        her hobby, she decided to switch to machines. For this purpose, she decided to buy her first motorcycle with her
        pocket money.
        <br /><br />
        During her first trimester, Kayama decided to try racing tournaments, winning cups and medals by taking first
        places. The director of Hope's Peak Academy saw her potential and offered her the opportunity to join the class
        of talented students without having to repeat the grade, giving her the title of "Ultimate Car Racer."
        <br /><br />
        She once challenged Mondo to a fast street race, winning it easily by passing him between narrow streets and
        obstacles.
        <br /><br />
        <br />
        <b>Analytical Skills</b><br />
        During one of the Class Trials, when Kayama had an objection to Hajime's statement, she started a Rebuttal
        Showdown. She had doubts about Hajime's arguments and presented a different point of view. During the argument
        battle, Hajime unexpectedly loses. As it later turns out, Kayama was right from the beginning, and the main
        character takes lessons from it and presents new evidence, agreeing with Kayama. In the next Class Trials, the
        protagonist focuses more on the details and killer’s perspective.
        <br /><br />
        <br />
        <b>Prophetic Dreams</b><br />
        While being a child, Kayama had a dream that the world would suffer a tragic defeat, which turns out to be a
        vision years later. Junko wanted to make sure that no one would spoil her plan, so she later tasked Ultimate
        Despair to find her.
        <br /><br />
        In Chapter 5, Kayama had another dream about accidentally killing one of the students, which ends in her
        execution. Kayama wakes up convinced that it is another prophetic dream, which causes her to start behaving
        strangely during the murder, thus exposing herself to accusations.
        <br /><br />
        However, not every dream is a vision, so she does not know what is true and what is a figment of her
        imagination.
        <br /><br />
        <br />
        <b>Extraordinary Strength and Endurance</b><br />
        Despite her stature, she also has strength and great endurance. In Free Time, Kayama confesses that she often
        had to use violence to defend herself from her old school bullies. This was often successful, leaving her alone
        for a good few weeks. She spared no effort even during the Tragedy.
        <br /><br />
        She also shows her strength when, while flirting with Kazuichi, she lifts him slightly from the ground, jokingly
        telling him about the dominance she could achieve. She also boasts about her strength by lifting heavy objects.
