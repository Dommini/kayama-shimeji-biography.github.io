      <h3>Family</h3>
      Not much is known about her family, but that they tried to give her a better start in life. Initially, they didn't
      have much money and often couldn’t buy her new clothes, which resulted in Kayama wearing smaller sizes. Before
      they managed to secure better conditions in Japan, Kayama had to face her old school, where she was bullied.
      <br /><br />
      In Island Mode, Kayama said that her mother was a painter and her father left them to work abroad. This had
      changed over time when, after saving enough, they moved to Japan in the hope of a better life.
      </p>

      <h3>Class 77-B:</h3>
      <h4>Kazuichi Soda</h4>
      <p>
        Before entering Neo World, Kayama and Kazuichi were classmates who had a passive relationship with each other.
        After some time, they slowly start to become closer during events organized by Chisa Yukizome. During school
        break, Kazuichi repairs her broken MP3, which surprises Kayama, however, he only did it to impress Sonia.
        <br /><br />
        Before the Tragedy, Kayama often visited the bike shop of Kazuichi's family, commissioning him to modify her
        motorbike, and spending time with him, which deepened their relationship with each other.
        <br /><br />
        At the beginning of the Killing School Trip, Kayama treats him as a friend, but after a while she tries to
        impress
        him. She doesn't look at him shallowly, like he looks at Sonia.
        <br /><br />
        Kayama defends him and compliments him in a rather unusual way. When Kazuichi is around, Kayama behaves
        completely
        differently than she does around her other classmates. While in everyday life she is temperamental and her way
        of
        speaking is ironic, though she’s usually calmer around him. She always tries to comfort him when Sonia rejects
        him, flirting with him in the process.
        <br /><br />
        Kayama also shows her kinky side by volunteering when Kazuichi talks about taking girls "pieces apart". She
        flirts
        many times back, which doesn't always result in Kazuichi's approval.
        <br /><br />
        After waking up from Neo World, Kazuichi pretended that Kayama was not his point of interest like Sonia, but at
        the end of Side: Hope - Students of Hope and Despair, Kayama kissed him in gratitude on the boat, which
        initially
        surprises Kazuichi, but also tells him that his feelings for her are starting to grow.
      </p>

      <h4>Sonia Nevermind</h4>
      <p>
        Despite Kazuichi's infatuation, Kayama has no negative thoughts about Sonia. In Killing School Trip, she is
        jealous that he was giving her too much attention. At one point, Sonia tries to help Kayama to get Kazuichi to
        notice her, which backfires.
      </p>

      <h4>Ibuki Mioda</h4>
      <p>
        After arriving on Jabberwock Island, Kayama and Ibuki became friends. When Hajime meets the new students, Kayama
        compliments her appearance as a "colorful girl with horns". Kayama was a fan of her music and went to her
        concerts
        before the Tragedy, she was also the only one who enjoyed her performance when Fuyuhiko returned from the
        hospital. They often spend time together during the Killing School Trip, which almost always leads to funny
        situations.
        <br /><br />
        After her death, Kayama is devastated, but tries to hide it, saying that she is used to people leaving. She
        promised that when they get off Jabberwock Island, she will strangle the game master with her own hands.
      </p>

      <h4>Hyoko Sajoinji</h4>
      <p>
        They don't have much interaction with each other, but Kayama liked her somehow. Kayama doesn't support Hiyoko
        when
        she mocks Mikan, but also doesn't defend Mikan because she thinks that she should get a grip and stop crying.
        However, Kayama tries to stop her as the jokes move on to Kazuichi.
      </p>

      <h4>Nagito Komaeda</h4>
      <p>
        Despite thinking he was weird, tries to understand his reasoning about hope. Unlike the others, she gives him a
        chance to speak because she saw herself as a reflection of him.
      </p>

      <h4>Chiaki Nanami</h4>
      <p>
        Kayama didn't know Chiaki that well before the Tragedy unlike her other classmates and also she doesn’t see her
        brutal death either. In Neo World she had the opportunity to get to know her better and Chiaki quickly gained
        sympathy for her.
      </p>

      <h3>Reserve Course Students:</h3>
      <h4>Hajime Hinata</h4>
      <p>
        Kayama initially attended the Reserve Course class with Hajime. He felt a bit jealous of her talent and then he
        was more willing to take part in Izuru Kamukura's project.
        <br /><br />
        After arriving on Jabberwock Island, Kayama felt a strange connection with Hajime, but she wasn't sure what it
        was. During one of the class trials, Kayama defends him, starting a debate in which she wins.
      </p>

      <h3>Class 78-B:</h3>
      <h4>Mondo Owada</h4>
      <p>
        Mondo and Kayama were close friends before attending Hope's Peak Academy and enjoyed riding their motorcycles in
        the evenings while spending time together. After some time, Mondo fell in love with Kayama, but this feeling was
        never revealed and reciprocated.
        <br /><br />
        He first saw her when she had an accident and decided to help her. After Mondo's death, she experienced the pain
        of losing an important person for the first time. Her view of the world changed and she vowed to stop all the
        chaos caused by despair.
      </p>

      <h4>Junko Enoshima</h4>
      <p>
        Junko secretly investigated the case of Kayama getting into the Main Course, due to the fact that she was the
        first person from the Reserve Course who managed to reach so high. Later, Kayama became a side target for her.
        However, she did not transform her into Ultimate Despair along with the others because she knew that Chiaki's
        death would not affect her much. She decided to give the Remnants of Despair a chance to prove themselves and,
        just for fun, she ordered them to finish Kayama off for her.
        <br /><br />
        Kayama first learned about Junko from Kazuichi, whom she worked with during the Tragedy. Since Junko did not
        know
        about her prophetic dreams, Kayama had a significant advantage over her, successfully hiding from the other
        Remnants of Despair.
