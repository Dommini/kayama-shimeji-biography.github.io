          Kayama is a tall girl with pale skin and intensive green eyes. She has
          a purple hair, arranged in Rather chaotic way. Her eyebrows are dark,
          and expressive, and she has a little slit on left eyebrow. On her face
          there are acne scars that look like freckles.
          <br />
          <br />
          Usually she wears a gray shirt with collar fastened with white
          buttons. Her shirt doesn't fit her waist, so the fabric is arranged in
          a strange way. As Ultimate Car Racer, she wear a ligt-gray pants with
          a chessboard on both sides. Her pants have suspenders with white
          arrows pattern sewn to it and have the brand's logo with metal eyelets
          on the back. Her dark-gray shoes are typically adapted for driving.
          She has leather gloves on her hands and black fishnet from under her
          shirt sleeves.

          <br />
          Kayama's ears are decorated with various gray jewerly. On her right
          side she has a skull and double helix piercing, while on her left she
          has circle shape with ring earring. On both earlobe she has a small
          stars earrings too. Due to her clumsiness and the fresh scars she
          acquired during racing tournaments, she wears bandages on arms and
          neck.
