      <p>
        Kayama is a tall girl with pale skin and intensive green eyes. She has purple hair, arranged in a rather chaotic
        way. Her eyebrows are dark and expressive, and she has a little slit on her left eyebrow. She has acne scars on
        her face, looking alike to freckles.
        <br /><br />
        Usually, she wears a gray shirt with a collar fastened with white buttons. Her shirt doesn't fit her waist, so
        the fabric is arranged in a strange way. As Ultimate Car Racer, she wears light-gray pants with a chessboard on
        both sides. Her pants have suspenders with white arrows pattern sewn to them and have the brand's logo with
        metal eyelets on the back. Her dark-gray shoes are typically adapted for driving. She has leather gloves on her
        hands and black fishnet from under her shirt sleeves.
        <br /><br />
        Kayama's ears are decorated with various gray jewelry. On her right side, she has a skull and double helix
        piercing, while on her left she has a circle shape with a ring earring. She also has small star earrings on both
        of her earlobes too. Due to her clumsiness and the fresh scars she got during racing tournaments, she wears
        bandages on her arms and neck.
        <br /><br />
        During the Tragedy, Kayama's appearance changes slightly. She has many wounds and unevenly cut hair. Her clothes
        are dirty and torn from struggles for survival. At the beginning of the Tragedy, she steals a Monokuma mask to
        hide her identity, and a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire for self-defense. Her left eye turns into spirals
        from time to time, a sign of the handful of despair she has become infected with.
